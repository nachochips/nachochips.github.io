Today I participated in the "Coding Challenge" operated by Metacode. It's a kind of community where you upload a number of problems you have solved. 
I do it only during the weekends and so far I have solved 6 problems on a Korean programming platform called "Programmers".
Today's code:
str = input()
list = list(str)
for i in list:
    print(i)
    
Also, I solved one Sololearn Python intermediate course. 
Learned about sets. 
Code: 
skills = {'Python', 'HTML', 'SQL', 'C++', 'Java', 'Scala'}
job_skills = {'HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'C#', 'NodeJS'}


candidateskills=(skills & job_skills)

for x in candidateskills: 
 print(str(x))
