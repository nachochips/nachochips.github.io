I'm super excited to share my latest adventure with you all! 🚀 
I've enrolled in a 6-week Deeplearning course offered by Metacode! 
During this course, I'll get to dive into the world of AI and learn how to create a model that colors black and white pictures using pix2pix, GAN! 🎨

Now, I must admit, I'm a total beginner in this field, but we all start somewhere, right? 
My main goal is to grasp the basic terms and concepts, so I'll be well-equipped to continue my studies in the future! 💪 
Our first class was on July 27th, and it was such an exciting experience! 

Our very first task is to create our own blog on Github. 📝 
I'm hoping that by documenting my progress, I can not only track my growth but also inspire others to join me on this learning adventure! 🌟

I won't lie; I'm a bit nervous about the remaining four weeks. But I'll stay positive and keep reminding myself that challenges make us stronger! 💪 So here's to pushing forward, learning, and growing together! 🌱 I promise I won't give up easily, and I'll try to keep posting my learning experiences.

Wish me luck! 🍀 And if any of you have tips or encouragement to share, feel free to drop them in the comments below! I'd really appreciate it!
