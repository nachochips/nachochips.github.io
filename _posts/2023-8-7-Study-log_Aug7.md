## Today's Coding Journey 🚀

Today I started my day tackling one Programmers' problem and  two Sololearn missions! 💪

### YouTube 
I finally completed the Machine Learning course on "생활코딩(Life Coding)" YouTube channel. It was good that the lecturer kept the listener motivated by training to think about the applicable real-life problems that can be solved using Machin Learning Techniques. 🧠

The below picture is the summary of the course (screenshot from the video):

Now that I finished the above course, I want to know the basic math that I need to study AI. 

1. 🎥 Microsoft Lecture - Given by Christopher Bishop the author of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, a book that was highly recommended by our professor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdHqrd1OMvw&list=PLqijQYffqJi9kjaNAVx3pnyetrwaWKtRd&ab_channel=MicrosoftResearch

2. 🎥 The Essence of Calculus - 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown).
