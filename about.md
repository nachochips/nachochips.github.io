### Little about myself 👩🏻‍💻🌍

Greetings! 🌟 
Allow me to introduce myself – I was born and raised in Brazil 🇧🇷, but moved to Korea 🇰🇷 in early 2000.

Above all else, I am a mother, blessed with the joy of nurturing one adorable bundle of joy 🍼. My little one inspires me every day to be the best version of myself.

Currently, I'm working in the Office of International Affairs at a university 🎓, where I get to explore the diverse cultures of the world 🌏 and make meaningful opportunities for students.

When it comes to my passions, I am truly captivated by the enchanting realms of programming and AI 🚀🤖. While I may be taking baby steps 🚶‍♀️ on this fascinating journey, my enthusiasm knows no bounds!

Dreaming big is the foundation of my aspirations ✨, but I understand that greatness is built through those small, consistent steps 🏗️. Embracing every challenge, I eagerly learn and grow, inching closer to my vision one step at a time.
